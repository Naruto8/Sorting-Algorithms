Contributing
================================================================================

If you want to contribute to [SDSA](https://github.com/ndesh26/SDSA), please follow these rules:

1. Press the fork button:

    ![fork](http://oi58.tinypic.com/jj2trm.jpg)

2. Clone the repository from your account with:

    ```
    git clone git@github.com:your_github_username/SDSA.git
    ```

3. Create a new branch with:

    ```
    git checkout -b "new feature"
    ```
    You can name it however you want.

4. Now you can start working on the project. If you are writing code, you should follow the code [fomatting style](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indent_style#K.26R_style). 

5. Don't forget to add yourself in `contributors.md`.

6. Commit and push your changes, then make a pull request from Github. Add a Signed-off-by line at the end of the commit by using the -s option.
    ```
    git commit -s
    ```  

**IMPORTANT**

Please, don't forget to update your fork. While you made your changes, the content of the `master` branch can change because other pull requests were merged and it can create conflicts. This is why you have to rebase on `master` every time before pushing your changes and check that your branch doesn't have any conflicts with `master`.
