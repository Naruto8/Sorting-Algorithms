## Standard Data Structures and Algorithms in C 

This is my attempt to make a small library which contains standard data structure and algorithms which
were taught in my course on Algorithms.

Data Structures Implemented:-

Algorithms Implemented:-

1. Sorting Algorithms

### More To Do

1. Implement heapSort.
2. various checks to avoid segfault.
3. use long int or long long int instead of int.
