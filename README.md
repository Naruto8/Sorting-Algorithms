## Sorting Algorithms in C

This is my attempt to make a small library which contains sorting algorithms which
were taught in my course on Algorithms.

The Functions implemeted:-

1. insertionSort
2. mergeSort
3. quickSort
4. countingSort
5. radixSort

### How to Use

All the functions are take a standard input the pointer to array, left index and the right index.
eg.

```c
insertionSort(int *arr, int left, int right)
```

### More To Do

1. Implement heapSort.
2. various checks to avoid segfault.
3. use long int or long long int instead of int.
